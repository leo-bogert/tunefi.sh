tunefi.sh
=========

A batch-transcoder script for converting FLAC files encoded with perfect-flac-batch-encode to ALAC.
Suitable for satisfying iTunes users who cannot playback FLAC because Apple decided to ignore open standards.

		PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.bin/shell-tools:$HOME/.bin/tunefi.sh"

Usage
=====

tunefi.sh <input directory> <output directory>

Output
======
For each folder in the input directory, tunefish encodes all FLACs in that folder to a folder in the output directory.
The folder in the output dir will have the same name as the folder in the input dir.
Each folder typically represents a music album.

The following files/directories are copied over from the input directory if they exist:
- Artwork
- Proof of Quality
- README.txt
- TODO.txt

Any files which are NOT in that list and are NOT *.flac result in an error message. The encoding will continue though.
